sorted-collections-rs
=====================

A library providing useful extension traits and convenience methods for ordered collections in Rust.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csouth3/sorted-collections-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csouth3/sorted-collections-rs)

## Usage
NOTE: This library is not even remotely done yet, and unpublished to crates.io as of yet.
I will publish the first version once I deem it to be at least somewhat usable.

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sorted-collections = "*"
```

And this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate "sorted-collections" as sorted_collections;
```
